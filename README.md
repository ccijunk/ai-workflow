# Flowctl

A node-graph workflow engine that takes a software spec and produces a code change.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Initialize a project

```bash
flowctl init
```

Creates `.flows/` directory structure:
- `.flows/config.yaml` - Framework configuration
- `.flows/workflows/` - Workflow definitions
- `.flows/prompts/` - Prompt templates
- `.flows/roles/` - Role configurations

### Run a workflow

```bash
# Dry run (mock execution)
flowctl run .flows/workflows/hello-world.yaml --dry-run

# Run with opencode executor
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --executor opencode

# Run with a GitHub issue
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --executor opencode --issue https://github.com/user/repo/issues/1
```

### Resume a workflow

If a workflow was interrupted, you can resume from where it stopped:

```bash
# Resume latest run
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --executor opencode --resume

# Resume specific run
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --executor opencode --run-id my-run --resume
```

### Logging

Workflow execution is logged to `.flows/runs/<run-id>/execution.log`:

```bash
# JSON format (default)
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --log-format json

# Text format
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --log-format text

# Debug level
flowctl run .flows/workflows/spec-to-code.yaml --log-level DEBUG
```

## CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Mock execution, creates placeholder artifacts |
| `--executor` | Executor type: `echo` (mock) or `opencode` |
| `--model` | Model override for opencode executor |
| `--agent` | Agent name for opencode executor |
| `--run-id` | Run identifier (default: `latest`) |
| `--issue` | GitHub issue URL to process |
| `--resume` | Resume from saved state |
| `--log-level` | Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR |
| `--log-format` | Log format: `json` or `text` |

## Workflow Structure

Workflows are defined in YAML with nodes and transitions:

```yaml
version: "1"

nodes:
  fetch_issue:
    role: fetcher
    prompt: prompts/fetch-issue.md
    executor: opencode
    inputs: {issue_url: issue-url.txt}
    outputs: {requirement: requirement.md}

  create_branch:
    role: pr-creator
    prompt: prompts/create-branch-issue.md
    executor: opencode
    inputs: {requirement: requirement.md, issue_url: issue-url.txt}
    outputs: {branch_name: branch-name.txt}

transitions:
  - from: __start__
    to: fetch_issue
  - from: fetch_issue
    to: create_branch
  - from: create_branch
    to: __end__
```

### Conditional Transitions

```yaml
transitions:
  - from: testing
    to: review
    when: pass == "yes"
  - from: testing
    to: fix_test
    when: pass == "no"
```

## Run Directory

Each workflow run creates artifacts in `.flows/runs/<run-id>/`:

- `execution.log` - Execution log (JSON or text)
- `state.json` - Saved state for resume (current_node, context, iterations)
- `*.txt`, `*.md` - Output artifacts from nodes

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```
